### ‚úåüèª Hey, I'm Jamees Bedford

I'm an Engineering Manager at [Attest](https://askattest.com), previously I was an Engineering Manager at the digital bank [Monzo](https://monzo.com). Before branching into technical leadership, I was a front-end developer, focusing on design systems.

I don't actually spell my name with two ee's. Its an internet name as my handle is usually 'jameesy'. It confuses people, which is in part amusing, but I share my name with someone that is famous for being cryopreserved so like to be different as those are big shoes to fill. Outside of the tech world, I am interested in minimalism & mindfulness. I live with my fiancee and shih-tzu in a small village in the Berkshire countryside, where we spend our days looking after our herd of Shetland Ponies and playing Animal Crossing.

I also:

- ‚ö´Ô∏è [Write](https://jame.es) about everything that interests me. Software, leadership, minimalism, mindfulness and productivity.
- ‚ö´Ô∏è [Send](https://jamees.substack.com) a weekly newsletter about software and reflection.
- ‚ö´Ô∏è [Read](https://jame.es/reading-list) a shit load of books and share my thoughts.

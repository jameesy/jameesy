Hey ✌️ I'm [James Bedford](https://jame.es), an Engineering Manager at [Attest](https://askattest.com), previously I was an Engineering Manager at the digital bank [Monzo](https://monzo.com). Before branching into technical leadership, I was a front-end developer, focusing on design systems and accessibility.

Outside of the tech world, I am interested in minimalism & mindfulness. I live with my fiancee and shih-tzu in a small village in the Berkshire countryside, where we spend our days looking after our herd of Shetland Ponies and playing Animal Crossing.

### ✌🏻 Hey, I'm James Bedford

I'm an Engineering Manager at [Attest](https://askattest.com), previously I was an Engineering Manager at the digital bank [Monzo](https://monzo.com). Before branching into technical leadership, I was a front-end developer.

Outside of the tech world, I am interested in minimalism & mindfulness. I live with my fiancee and shih-tzu in a small village in the Berkshire countryside, where we spend our days looking after our herd of Shetland Ponies.

I also:

- [Write](https://jame.es) about everything that interests me. Software, leadership, minimalism, mindfulness and productivity.
- [Send](https://jamees.substack.com) a weekly newsletter about software and reflection.
- [Read](https://literal.club/james) a shit load of books and share my thoughts.


🖤
